Right now this screen is perfect for one-off SMS…
But in the store you want speed: tech finishes repair → 2 clicks → SMS sent.

A. Add “Common Templates” under Message Type

Instead of only a dropdown with “Google Review Request”, add more options:

⭐ Google Review Request

🔔 Device Ready for Pickup

🔁 Follow-Up / Check-In

💬 Custom Message

When the user changes message type:

Auto-change the default SMS body behind the scenes

Show a live preview panel at the bottom (before Send)

B. Make “Google Review Link” a setting, not a per-send field

You’ll almost never change the review URL.

Change:

Move the Google Review Link out of this form into a Settings or Billing / Account tab.

On this screen, just use it automatically in the preview.

This makes the form mentally lighter:
Name, phone, optional notes, photo → Send.

C. Reduce typing with “Recent Customers” dropdown

Because RepairDesk already has all the repair data, you don’t want staff retyping names & phones.

Even without full integration yet, you can:

Add a small “Recent customers” dropdown or search box above the form:

type “ya…” → show “Yanni – iPhone 13 – (954) …”

when selected → auto-fill name + phone.

Later you can hook this to:

a simple SQLite table in your app, or

RepairDesk export/API.

2️⃣ UI tweaks on this screen (keeping your style)
✅ Keep (it’s already great)

The gradient header card “Quick Fill from Repair Order (Optional)” – looks premium.

The tabs (Send SMS / Dashboard / History / Customers / Billing).

Overall spacing, rounded inputs, and copy tone.

🔧 Improvements
1. Turn the screen into clear “Step 1 / Step 2”

Above the “Quick Fill” card:

Step 1 – Get customer details
(Upload repair order or type manually)

Then below it:

Step 2 – Compose & send SMS

This matches how your staff thinks and reduces confusion.

2. Make upload area more action-y

Inside the pink card:

Left button:

Label: “Upload repair order photo”

Subtitle: “We’ll read the name + phone automatically”

Right button:

Label: “Take photo with camera”

Below the card, after upload, show a mini-summary:

Detected:
Name: John Smith
Phone: +1 954…
[Use these] [Edit]

That makes the AI/OCR feature feel magical and avoids wrong data.

3. Emphasize required fields visually

Right now Customer Name + Phone are marked with * only.

Add subtle hints:

If empty, show red border on blur.

Show small text under the phone field when invalid:

“Please enter a valid mobile number with country code.”

This avoids Twilio errors later.

4. Add a live “Message Preview” card before Send

Under “Attach Photo of Repair” area, add a simple preview box:

📲 Preview
“Hi John, thank you for choosing Techy Miramar.
If you were happy with your repair, could you leave us a quick review?
[Google Review Link]”

Dynamically replace {{name}} + add Additional Message.

This gives confidence to your staff and lets you keep templates locked but still slightly editable.

5. Make the primary button very clear

At the bottom (out of screenshot) your main button should be:

Send SMS via Twilio

Below it, a tiny secondary text:

“This will send 1 SMS to +1 954… using your Twilio number.”
