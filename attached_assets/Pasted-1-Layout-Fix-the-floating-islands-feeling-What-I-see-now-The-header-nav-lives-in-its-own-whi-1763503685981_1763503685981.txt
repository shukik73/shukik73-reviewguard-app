1️⃣ Layout: Fix the “floating islands” feeling

What I see now:

The header/nav lives in its own white card on the left.

The “Send SMS / Step 1 / Step 2” cards are more centered/right.

Big empty gradient space between them.

Goal: Everything should feel like one unified app shell, not separate boxes.

What to change

Wrap everything in a single centered container:

<div class="app-container">
  <!-- header + nav -->
  <!-- main content (Send SMS, etc.) -->
</div>


Give that container:

.app-container {
  max-width: 1100px;
  margin: 24px auto;      /* centers everything */
  padding: 0 16px;
}


Put your top white nav bar inside this container and above the “Send SMS” title.
Right now it looks like a separate panel stuck in the corner; we want:

[ header + nav (full width of container) ]
[ Send SMS title ]
[ Step 1 card   ][ Step 2 card ]

2️⃣ Navigation bar: Make it feel like a true top nav

Right now your nav is great, just a bit “chunky” and small-card-ish.

Small visual upgrades

Stretch it to the same width as the main content:
width: 100% inside .app-container.

Remove large border radius on the whole nav card (keep 8px max).

Keep small rounded buttons for tabs (they already look good).

You’re basically 10% away from a Stripe-style bar.

3️⃣ Send SMS panel: Tighten spacing & hierarchy

The 2-column layout is solid. A few tweaks will make it sharper:

Move “Send SMS” closer to the cards
Reduce top margin so the title hugs the cards, like:

h1.send-sms-title {
  margin: 16px 0 12px;
}


Step card widths
On big screens, give Step 1 about 30–35% width, Step 2 about 65–70%.
You already have that visually; just make sure they’re aligned perfectly horizontally.

Message Preview
You nailed this. Just make the preview card a tiny bit shorter in height so it doesn’t overpower the form. You can reduce its padding slightly.

4️⃣ Buttons: You’re 95% there, let’s polish the last 5%

From your screenshot the main “Send SMS” button looks great, but:

Make all primary actions (Send SMS, Subscribe, Save Settings) the exact same style:

same gradient

same radius

same font size

same height

That visual consistency = “this is a real product.”

If you’re using CSS, define one .btn-primary and reuse it everywhere instead of styling each button separately.

5️⃣ Mobile: Make sure it collapses nicely

You don’t need to code anything crazy, just check these:

On a phone, Step 1 and Step 2 should stack vertically (Step 1 on top, Step 2 below).

The nav buttons should wrap into multiple lines (they already sort of do).

Make sure the gradient background doesn’t push things too far down; content should start close to the top.

6️⃣ Overall design verdict (investor hat on)

Strengths:

Gradient background = modern SaaS feeling ✅

Clear steps (Step 1 / Step 2) ✅

Beautiful message preview ✅

Icons on nav buttons = friendly and clear ✅

Totally good enough to sell right now ✅

Opportunities / blind spots:

Layout still looks like multiple separate cards rather than one unified app.

Too much “empty purple space” to the left of the main content.

Header/nav card feels “detached” from the rest of the page.

Once you:

center everything in one container

move the header/nav above content

align the cards under it

…it’ll instantly look like something built by a venture-backed startup.
